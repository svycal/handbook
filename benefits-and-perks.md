# Benefits

## Paid Time Off

### Vacation Time

SavvyCal offers 18 days of paid time off plus [U.S. federal holidays](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/federal-holidays/#url=2022) for full-time employees. We ask that you track your vacation time via Gusto, so we can properly compensate you for unused time. Your vacation time is accrued throughout the year in pay periods. Your vacation time rolls over year to year, with a maximum bank of 27 days. If you are terminated or resign from SavvyCal with vacation days in your bank, you'll be paid the monetary equivalent for those unused days (based on your salary).

### Sick Time

If you're sick, take the time you need to feel better. We don't have a set limit on sick time. As such, these hours are not accrued in a bank (like your vacation time). We ask that you track your sick time via Gusto and keep your manager informed about when you expect to be back at work.

## Family Leave

To help you celebrate the welcome of your new family addition (and get some much needed family time and rest), we offer both primary and non-primary caregivers paid family leave as follows: 

**Primary Caregivers**

- 8 weeks of fully paid leave
- 4 additional weeks of unpaid time is available, for those who request it

**Non-Primary Caregivers**

- 4 weeks of fully paid leave
- 8 additional weeks of unpaid time off is available, for those who request it

This policy covers all full-time employees who need time away from work to care for and bond with a new child, biological or adopted.
